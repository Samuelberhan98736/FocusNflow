# FOCUSNFLOW

**Description**:  FocusNFlow is a campus wide study organizer designed to eliminate the chaos of finding study spaces and forming study groups. The platform gives students a live map of campus resource availability helping them instantly locate open study rooms and join collaborative sessions without relying on scattered group chats. With features like campus authentication, realtime occupancy tracking, course based study group formation, integrated group chat, study session session scheduling and shared pomodoro timer with collaborative goal setting, FocusNFlow turns academic collaboration into a structured efficient work flow. By synchronizing group schedules, study goals and live room availability, the project aims to solve the most frustrating parts of college productivity
